### Hello! I'm Steven Moses (😄he/him), a software engineer 👨🏾‍💻, avid concert-goer🎤, literary fiction fan📚, and proud guitar noodler🎸, currently developing full-stack web apps for small businesses in the SF Bay Area. 

As a freelance musician I lived a life that was busy.  I made the switch to software engineering over the pandemic and have launched a multitude of successful full stack projects!

Take a gander @ some of my projects: 

- 📚 ReadingTime - a habit tracker for readers to get a daily reading habit in. Helped me read over 100 books in 2023! [Try it out!](https://readingtime-nextjs.vercel.app/)
- 🔎 MeepleMatch - a board game finder for nerds. [No more analysis paralysis on game night!](https://meeplematch-blush.vercel.app/en) 
- 🎸 BatonPass - a full stack social network app for directors and ensembles to better find each other. [Assemble your ensemble!](https://batonpass.up.railway.app)
