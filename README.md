### Hello! I'm Steven Moses (😄he/him), a software engineer 👨🏾‍💻, avid concert-goer🎤, literary fiction fan📚, and proud guitar noodler🎸.

Before 2020 I was a freelance musician, working with hundreds of people to bring countless ideas to life. I've taken that creativity & team-oriented spirit to the world of software, bringing tech from 0 to 1.
