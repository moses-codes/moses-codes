### Hello! I'm Steven Moses (😄he/him), a software engineer 👨🏾‍💻, avid concert-goer🎤, literary fiction fan📚, and proud guitar noodler🎸, currently developing full-stack web apps for small businesses in the SF Bay Area. 

Prior to 2020, music was my life; when the pandemic brought music to a halt, I found myself with a lot of extra time; in that time, I started programming, first with HTML & CSS, then with Javascript, and now to full stack apps in the MERN stack. I began freelancing this year, and am currently orchestrating my first full stack application.


- 🔭 I've just finished the MVP of BatonPass - a full stack social network app for directors and ensembles to better find each other.
